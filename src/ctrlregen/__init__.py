"""CtrlRegen watermark removal via controllable regeneration.

Implements the pipeline from "Image Watermarks Are Removable Using
Controllable Regeneration from Clean Noise" (ICLR 2025) by Liu et al.

This sub-package uses a ControlNet for spatial guidance (canny edges)
and a DINOv2-based IP Adapter for semantic guidance to regenerate
watermarked images from partially noised latents.
