"""Custom Stable Diffusion ControlNet Img2Img pipeline for CtrlRegen.

Extends ``StableDiffusionControlNetImg2ImgPipeline`` with the
``load_ctrlregen_ip_adapter`` method (via ``CustomIPAdapterMixin``)
that swaps in DINOv2-giant as the image encoder and loads the
CtrlRegen semantic-control adapter weights.

No ``encode_image`` override is needed — the CtrlRegen checkpoint
creates an ``IPAdapterPlusImageProjection`` which tells diffusers to
call ``encode_image`` with ``output_hidden_states=True``.  The
default implementation then uses ``hidden_states[-2]`` from DINOv2,
which is exactly what the projection was trained on.
